# Integer Base Converter from base 10
This software module uses simple arithmetic operations to demonstrate conversion of base 10 integers to other number bases in the following range [2, 16].

Decimal numbers and negative numbers are not (yet) implemented here since they are not as widely used with this type of numeric conversion as with integers, moreover, there are different techniques to convert to negative binary numbers and only one (probably two's complement binary) method will be implemented in this demonstration.
